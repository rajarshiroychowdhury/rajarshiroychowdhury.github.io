  abstract = {Reliable power system network is necessary to meet the needs of the ongoing research establishments on the lunar surface. Interconnected microgrids on the lunar surface will help in load sharing during extreme failure events. However, detailed system-level planning including network resiliency is crucial to make the system survive during high-impact low probability events. A three-stage graph theory-based planning methodology for the interconnected lunar microgrid network is proposed to maximize the network resiliency and minimize the load shedding. The methodology utilizes the hybrid-edge rewiring technique to identify the potential connections between the individual microgrids and secondary lines to enhance the lunar microgrid resiliency. A directed-weighted graph model approach is used to represent the interconnected lunar microgrid network. Various graph theory metrics are used to quantify the resiliency of the interconnected microgrid network. Different case studies are conducted to identify the potential connections for the zonal microgrid of the interconnected lunar microgrid network.}

  abstract = {Grid modernization and innovations in clean energy are leading to a rapid increase in the penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) like wind power and solar photovoltaic (PV) plants in the bulk power system (BPS). To study the implications on BPS dynamics and mitigate potential risks to grid reliability, the second-generation generic renewable energy system model has been developed earlier. However, this model has three modules with 86 user-defined parameters and eight control flags to facilitate the utility-scale solar PV plant operation in different control modes. It presents a major challenge to the transmission system planning engineers. There is a critical need to identify the key parameters of the dynamic model that are highly sensitive to grid events causing large-scale voltage and frequency disturbances. In this work, a sensitivity analysis based on modified Sobol’ method is proposed for identification of the key parameters in the utility-scale solar PV plant model. The total Sobol’ sensitivity index captures even the higher-order effects of the variations in the parameters. Validation of the identified key parameters was carried out on a modified IEEE 9-bus system and 200-bus synthetic grid using PSS®E for plant-level control and local coordinated control operation of the solar PV plant. The reduced set of parameters identified in this work offer help to utility grid planning teams while conducting dynamic studies to meet the interconnection requirements.

  abstract = {The United States has seen an enormous influx of single-phase behind-the-meter installations in the last decade. With the latest Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) order 2222, these behind-the-meter installations can be aggregated and participate in the power markets by providing ancillary services. Hence, controlling smart inverters to maintain power quality in the distribution grid remains challenging. With multiple smaller units forming an aggregation and responding to market signals, nearby standalone single-phase behind-the-meter smart inverters would need better controls to react to frequency excursions. This paper presents an Angular Space Repetitive Control (ASRC)-based Active Power Filter (APF) for a single-phase smart inverter used predominantly in behind-the-meter installations. The proposed control guarantees power quality during large-scale frequency excursions, well above and beyond the stipulated frequency range (59.5-61 Hz) strictly enforced throughout North America. The proposed controller is modeled in Simulink, and the response to input frequency deviations shows a current Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of less than 3 percent even under extreme frequency excursions.}

  abstract = {Electric Power System (EPS) is widely regarded as one of the most complex artificial systems ever created. With the recent penetration of distributed energy resources, controlling the power systems is becoming even more challenging. This paper presents the use of the Dueling DQN (DDQN) Reinforcement Learning algorithm to control line switching and substation topology of the EPS to maintain line flow within limits for all contingency scenarios. The DDQN algorithm is particularly suited in power systems as often, the state of the environment might not be widely affected due to an agent’s actions, particularly during normal operating conditions. This allows the DDQN agent to quickly learn the states that are not important - a definite advantage over traditional vanilla Deep Q Networks. In the case of real-time control of the EPS, not learning all the redundant states has the advantage of fast convergence and reduced training time, both highly desirable in a complex use case like the one studied. The DDQN algorithm was tested on the standard IEEE 14 bus system, and the agent managed to maintain system stability under varied grid operating scenarios.}

  abstract={Recent advancements in aircraft electrification have led to the introduction of turboelectric distributed propulsion (TeDP). For instance, NASA's N3X airplane aims to curb jet fuel emissions with the aid of TeDP. However, it is crucial to analyze the survivability of the TeDP system during extreme conditions. The endogenous failure events are of specific interest as they were found to cause a significant number of accidents for commercial aircraft. While the distribution reconfiguration is necessary to meet the critical load demands under extreme failure events, it can also create a transient overload condition in the turboshaft engine. The power system survivability is further deteriorated in the presence of constant power loads. In this article, a mathematical analysis of the survivability of the system is presented to make the aircraft power system highly resilient to endogenous failure events. A power system collapse mitigation strategy is proposed by adding an energy storage system. Moreover, the analytical expressions are formulated to size the energy storage unit to prevent the system collapse. Various failure conditions are modeled using PSCAD/EMTDC to study the minimum energy storage required to prevent system collapse.

  abstract = {Reactive power capability of distributed photovoltaic (PV) inverters is exploited to mitigate voltage violations under high PV penetration in the distribution grid. Coordinating the reactive power compensations of individual PV inverters to obtain desired voltage regulation performance is a major challenge. In this paper, a decentralized method is proposed to enable PV inverters to autonomously regulate terminal node voltages. The proposed method minimizes the effect of a terminal node's reactive power compensation on the voltage profile of its respective parent-to-terminal node. This ensures that the interference between the voltage regulation of terminal nodes by individual PV inverters is minimized. The performance of the proposed decentralized scheme is verified by extensive powerflow simulations of the EPRI Circuit 24 test feeder in open-source distribution system simulation platform OpenDSS.}
