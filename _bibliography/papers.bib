  abstract = {The increasing deployment of Synchrophasor or Pha-sor Measurement Units (PMUs) 
  across North America helped utilities and system operators enhance monitoring and better 
  power system observability. PMUs can provide synchronized, high-resolution data on voltage 
  and current phasors, enabling real-time situational awareness and control of the power system. 
  This widespread deployment of PMUs has helped system monitoring, offering utilities unprecedented 
  insight into grid dynamics like system phase changes or bifurcations. One of the critical challenges posed 
  by this proliferation of PMUs is the vast volume of data generated, necessitating advanced data analytics 
  techniques for effective decision-making. However, data analytics needs to be done faster and 
  computationally efficiently to implement the developed algorithm in a utility grid control room. 
  In this research, the authors proposed a data-driven method to analyze power system bifurcations with 
  PMU data using statistical metrics known as Early Warning Signals. Generally, bifurcations can lead 
  to voltage instability, frequency fluctuations, and even blackouts. Hence, timely detection of 
  bifurcations and types, both pre-event if possible or post-event for detailed forensics with the proposed 
  data-driven method, helps utilities identify critical patterns and correlations in PMU data, 
  allowing for proactive grid stability and reliability management.}

  abstract = {Increasing commercial and industrial (C&I) customers are on board with a 
  clean-energy future by installing photovoltaic (PV) systems at their facilities to 
  compensate for the electricity supplied by the utilities. On the other hand, utilities may require no
  reverse power flow back to the bulk power system unless the customer is willing to pay potential 
  network upgrading costs and follow ISO/RTO’s interconnection process. In the meantime, most 
  equipment and devices of C&I customers are sensitive to voltage fluctuations caused by fault or switching events in the utility’s system. Voltage quality is a challenge to both the customer and 
  the supplying utility. Therefore, a battery energy storage system (BESS), which can control power 
  flow and is able to provide a fast response to voltage fluctuations during system events, 
  is one of the best solutions. In addition to maximizing the PV penetrations, the BESS can be further 
  utilized to track the locational marginal prices (LMPs) for energy arbitrage. As a result, a 
  multi-objective optimization problem is needed to size the BESS to maximize the “bang for the buck”. 
  This paper presents a real-world case study for a manufacturing customer to achieve decarbonization, 
  arbitrage, and voltage quality improvement using a BESS optimal sizing algorithm and practical 
  considerations. We believe the proposed approach can be adopted by other utilities or renewable

abstract = {Increasing demand for electricity and frequent power outages are common factors that are necessitating power utility companies to refurbish the existing power distribution systems. 
To avoid such expensive upgrades, a practical and more viable alternative solution is to use a 
battery energy storage system (BESS) that can participate in peak shaving requirements and 
function as an additional power source during power outages. In this context, this work develops
an optimization model to optimally determine the size and site of a BESS connected to the distribution
network for the purpose of two critical service options, namely peak shaving and reliability improvement,
under both system normal and outage scenarios. Nonlinearities due to the sizing and siting variables of 
the BESS are linearized using the big-M method, and the resulting model becomes a mixed-integer 
linear programming (MILP) problem. The decisions made during planning, namely the size and location
of the BESS, directly impact operational decisions regarding how the BESS supports peak shaving 
and outage management, if applicable. By considering a utility’s historical load and outage data, 
the efficacy of the proposed model is validated on a realistic distribution circuit that 
is located at the edge of a service territory with no circuit ties. The optimal BESS allocation 
obtained from the model achieves up to 93.5% enhancement in the system’s reliability and also decreases 
the feeder’s peak demand by about 17% for a one-year planning horizon. The case studies demonstrate 
that the model is computationally scalable and efficient, and electric distribution planners may benefit 
from this study and use this as a framework for possible BESS integration to defer expensive peak 
capacity-related upgrades while adding an extra source for backup power supply.}

To study the implications on BPS dynamics and mitigate potential risks to grid reliability, the second-generation generic renewable energy system model has been developed earlier. However, this model has three modules with 86 user-defined parameters and eight control flags to facilitate the utility-scale solar PV plant operation in different control modes. It presents a major challenge to the transmission system planning engineers. There is a critical need to identify the key parameters of the dynamic model that are highly sensitive to grid events causing large-scale voltage and frequency disturbances. In this work, a sensitivity analysis based on modified Sobol’ method is proposed for identification of the key parameters in the utility-scale solar PV plant model. The total Sobol’ sensitivity index captures even the higher-order effects of the variations in the parameters. Validation of the identified key parameters was carried out on a modified IEEE 9-bus system and 200-bus synthetic grid using PSS®E for plant-level control and local coordinated control operation of the solar PV plant. The reduced set of parameters identified in this work offer help to utility grid planning teams while conducting dynamic studies to meet the interconnection requirements.

With the latest Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) order 2222, these behind-the-meter installations can be aggregated and participate in the power markets by providing ancillary services. Hence, controlling smart inverters to maintain power quality in the distribution grid remains challenging. With multiple smaller units forming an aggregation and responding to market signals, nearby standalone single-phase behind-the-meter smart inverters would need better controls to react to frequency excursions. This paper presents an Angular Space Repetitive Control (ASRC)-based Active Power Filter (APF) for a single-phase smart inverter used predominantly in behind-the-meter installations. The proposed control guarantees power quality during large-scale frequency excursions, well above and beyond the stipulated frequency range (59.5-61 Hz) strictly enforced throughout North America. The proposed controller is modeled in Simulink, and the response to input frequency deviations shows a current Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of less than 3 percent even under extreme frequency excursions.}

This paper presents the use of the Dueling DQN (DDQN) Reinforcement Learning algorithm to control line switching and substation topology of the EPS to maintain line flow within limits for all contingency scenarios. The DDQN algorithm is particularly suited in power systems as often, the state of the environment might not be widely affected due to an agent’s actions, particularly during normal operating conditions. This allows the DDQN agent to quickly learn the states that are not important - a definite advantage over traditional vanilla Deep Q Networks. In the case of real-time control of the EPS, not learning all the redundant states has the advantage of fast convergence and reduced training time, both highly desirable in a complex use case like the one studied. The DDQN algorithm was tested on the standard IEEE 14 bus system, and the agent managed to maintain system stability under varied grid operating scenarios.}

For instance, NASA's N3X airplane aims to curb jet fuel emissions with the aid of TeDP. However, it is crucial to analyze the survivability of the TeDP system during extreme conditions. The endogenous failure events are of specific interest as they were found to cause a significant number of accidents for commercial aircraft. While the distribution reconfiguration is necessary to meet the critical load demands under extreme failure events, it can also create a transient overload condition in the turboshaft engine. The power system survivability is further deteriorated in the presence of constant power loads. In this article, a mathematical analysis of the survivability of the system is presented to make the aircraft power system highly resilient to endogenous failure events. A power system collapse mitigation strategy is proposed by adding an energy storage system. Moreover, the analytical expressions are formulated to size the energy storage unit to prevent the system collapse. Various failure conditions are modeled using PSCAD/EMTDC to study the minimum energy storage required to prevent system collapse.

The proposed method minimizes the effect of a terminal node's reactive power compensation on the voltage profile of its respective parent-to-terminal node.
