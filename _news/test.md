<!-- A simple inline announcement with Markdown emoji! :sparkles: :smile: -->
I will be leading the AES Utilities team as the Principal Investigator (PI) for a recently awarded DOE project titled <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/solar-and-wind-grid-services-and-reliability-demonstration-funding-program"><i>'Enabling 100% Renewable Energy Integration: Creativity-based Co-design and Demonstration of Intelligent Modeling, Protection, and Grid-edge Control of Bulk Power Systems'</i> </a>. The overall project will be led by Lina He from UIC Chicago. Other partners include NREL, COMED, GE and Siemens. The project is scheduled to start from September, 2023. AES Utilities will help the team by providing subject matter expertise on the development of advanced controls for future high penetration of IBR scenarios and also demonstrate the developed control algorithms both in HILS and later in a selected AES substation either in Indiana or in Ohio.
