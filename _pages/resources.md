###### :computer: The following lists some of the open source power system tools that might be helpful for students and academic researchers. 

1. Power System Dynamics, DAE modeling, simulation, and control: [ANDES](https://github.com/curent/andes)
2. Steady state power flow simulation and optimization for MATLAB and Octave: [MATPOWER](https://github.com/MATPOWER/matpower)
3. Power Distribution System Simulator: [OpenDSS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/electricdss/)
4. Steady State Power System Analysis: [Pandapower](https://github.com/e2nIEE/pandapower)
5. Power Sysstem Optimization : [PyPSA](https://github.com/PyPSA/PyPSA)

###### :books: Books and Courses that I recommend for anyone willing to learn power systems (in no specific order) :

1. Basic Power System Analysis : [Stevenson](https://www.amazon.com/Analysis-Grainger-Professor-Electrical-Engineering/dp/0070612935)
2. Dr. Tom Overbye's teaching webpage has made all its courses free to public. It's a treasure trove of knowledge and I highly recommend budding power system engineers to learn from this excellent resource. Also please take a look at his book from where I learned the basics of power systems analysis more than a decade back.
