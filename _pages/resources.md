###### :computer: The following open-source tools may be useful for students and academic researchers working on power system modeling, simulation, and analysis. Practicing industry engineers may already have access to equivalent commercial platforms.

1. Power System Dynamics, DAE modeling, simulation, and control: [ANDES](https://github.com/curent/andes)
2. Steady state power flow simulation and optimization for MATLAB and Octave: [MATPOWER](https://github.com/MATPOWER/matpower)
3. Power Distribution System Simulator: [OpenDSS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/electricdss/)
4. Steady State Power System Analysis: [Pandapower](https://github.com/e2nIEE/pandapower)
5. Power System Optimization : [PyPSA](https://github.com/PyPSA/PyPSA)

###### :books: For anyone seeking a strong foundation in **power systems**, familiarity with the following areas is essential:

- Linear algebra and matrix methods  
- Network analysis and steady-state power system modeling  
- Electromechanical energy conversion  
- Classical feedback control theory  

The resources below are organized roughly from **introductory** to **advanced**.

1. Beginner level power system analysis by Stevenson & Grainger. This book is a great introduction to power system analysis and is highly recommended as a first course in power systems. Power System Analysis : [Stevenson Book](https://www.amazon.com/Analysis-Grainger-Professor-Electrical-Engineering/dp/0070612935)
2. Another beginner level power system analysis book by Hadi Saadat. This book is also a great introduction to power system and can be used with the book by Stevenson. Power System Analysis Third Edition : [Hadi Saadat Book](https://www.amazon.com/Power-System-Analysis-Third-Saadat-dp-0984543864/dp/0984543864/ref=dp_ob_title_bk#customerReviews)
3. Tom Overbye's teaching webpage at TAMU has made all its courses free to public. It's a treasure trove of knowledge and I highly recommend budding power system engineers to learn from this excellent resource. Also please take a look at his book from where I learned the basics of power systems analysis more than a decade back.

1. Power System Dynamics and Stability by Peter W. Sauer and M. A. Pai. This book is a fantastic theoretical introduction to the complex concepts of power system dynamics. The book is available for free in this link : [Sauer & Pai Book](https://courses.physics.illinois.edu/ece576/sp2018/Sauer%20and%20Pai%20book%20-%20Jan%202007.pdf)
2. An introductory four set of lectures by Prof 
Yoash Levron & Prof Juri Belikov. I recommend these four lectures for a beginner friendly introduction to power system dynamics before going in depth with some of the books mentioned later. [Levron & Belikov Lectures](https://a-lab.ee/projects/dq0-dynamics)
1. The book that every power system engineer who would like to understand dynamics needs to read at some point is the one by Dr. Kundur on Power System Stability and Control. I read the first edition years back and is linked here : [Kundur 1st Edition Book ](https://www.amazon.com/System-Stability-Control-Prabha-Kundur/dp/007035958X). There is also a recent 2nd edition of this book available here : [Kundur 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Power-System-Stability-Control-Second-dp-1260473546/dp/1260473546/ref=dp_ob_title_bk)
2. Power System Dynamics: Stability and Control 3rd Edition, John Wiley & Sons by Jan Machowski, Zbigniew Lubosny, Janusz W. Bialek, James R. Bumby (2020):  [Machowski Book](https://www.amazon.com/Power-System-Dynamics-Stability-Control/dp/1119526345/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)
3. Power System Control and Stability, 3rd Edition,John Wiley & Sons by Vijay Vittal, James D. McCalley, Paul M. Anderson, A. A. Fouad (2019.): [Vittal Book](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Power+System+Control+and+Stability,+3rd+Edition-p-9781119433712)
4. Power System Dynamics by James McCalley, EE554 at Iowa State. Closely follows his book above: [EE554: Iowa State Course](https://home.engineering.iastate.edu/~jdm/ee554/schedule.htm)
5.  Power System Dynamics and Stability: With Synchrophasor Measurement and Power System Toolbox, 2nd Edition, by Peter W. Sauer, M. A. Pai, Joe H. Chow. This is a new edition to the classic 1st edition of Sauer and Pai: [Sauer, Pai, Chow 2nd Ed Book](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Power+System+Dynamics+and+Stability:+With+Synchrophasor+Measurement+and+Power+System+Toolbox,+2nd+Edition-p-9781119355779)
6.   Power System Dynamics and Stability, EE 552 by Baosen Zhang, University of Washington! Course Link : [Baosen Zhang, F22 Course](https://zhangbaosen.github.io/teaching/EE552)
