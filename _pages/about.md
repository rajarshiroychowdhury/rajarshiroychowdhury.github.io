Hi there! This is Rajarshi (‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶ú‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶∑‡¶ø). I know my name can be a mouthful üòÑ ‚Äî so feel free to call me **Raj**. And if you're curious, the name ‚ÄòRajarshi‚Äô in Bengali (‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ) loosely translates to ‚Äúa king who has the qualities of a sage.‚Äù

### A bit about my work‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm a **grid modernization and power systems strategy leader** with over a decade of experience in **bulk power system planning, interconnection, stability, and advanced controls**.

Currently, I serve as a **Technical Leader** at the **Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)**, where I lead consulting and applied R&D projects for utility clients across North America and globally. My role involves working closely with system planners, operators, and policymakers to help modernize the grid, enable clean energy integration, and ensure stability and reliability in a fast-changing landscape.

Previously, I led the **T&D Advanced Studies** team for AES US Utilities ‚Äî including **AES Ohio** and **AES Indiana** ‚Äî where I oversaw long-term planning, stability, EMT, and interconnection studies. These efforts helped shape strategic transmission investments that not only strengthened regional reliability but also supported economic development across the Midwest.

Before that, I was at **Ford Motor Company**, helping architect next-generation electrical systems for the **F-150** and **Mustang Mach-E**. And somewhere along the way, I picked up a **Professional Engineer (PE) license** in Ohio, collaborated on multiple **DOE-funded projects**, and contributed to working groups across **PJM, NERC, WECC**, and **IEEE**.

### What I enjoy

I'm passionate about translating technical problems into practical, scalable solutions ‚Äî whether it's decarbonization, resilience planning, or understanding the physics of the grid. I also love mentoring early-career engineers, speaking at webinars, and being part of honest, nerdy conversations about where the power sector is headed.
