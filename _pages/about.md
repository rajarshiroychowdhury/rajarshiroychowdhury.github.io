Hi there! This is Rajarshi. I work in the field of power system dynamics and control. 

Over the years, I have had the privilege of contributing to numerous groundbreaking projects in the field. From optimizing control strategies to mitigate disruptions caused by renewable energy integration, to developing advanced algorithms for real-time monitoring and prediction of system dynamics, my work is driven by a desire to enhance the efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of power systems.

I firmly believe in the power of collaboration and interdisciplinary approaches. If you are an industry professional and wish to connect, for a technical webinar or pick my brain on a topic related to power systems, send me a email. If you're a student and would like to be mentored, please send me a detailed email on your research interests and your expectations from this mentorship. I have mentored many students at all levels from undergrads to postgrads and continue to receive mentorship requests. Since its impossible for me to accept all requests, a clearly written email with your research interests and goals will help me to understand if this is a collaboration worthwhile for both of us to pursue. 

 I invite you to explore my website, where you'll find some of my insights, projects, resources, and updates in the field of power systems. Whether you're an industry professional, researcher, or simply curious about the remarkable intricacies of electricity grids, I hope you find inspiration and valuable information within these virtual walls.
