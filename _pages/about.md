Hi there! This is Rajarshi (রাজর্ষি). Many people call me **Raj**. And if you're curious, the name ‘Rajarshi’ in my native language, Bengali (বাংলা) loosely translates to “a king who has the qualities of a sage.”

### A bit about my work…

I’m a **grid modernization and power systems strategy leader** with over a decade of experience in **bulk power system planning, interconnection, stability, and operational planning strtegies.**.

Currently, I serve as the **Manager of Transmission Planning** at **Xcel Energy’s western footprint (Public Service Company of Colorado – PSCo)**, where I lead long-term transmission planning and regional reliability studies across Colorado and the broader Western Interconnection. My responsibilities include overseeing technically rigorous planning analyses, coordinating with transmission owners and regional entities, and supporting decision-making processes that align reliability requirements, policy objectives, and evolving resource portfolios. My team’s work informs major transmission investment decisions and supports regulatory review through transparent assumptions, defensible methodologies, and clear communication of system impacts.


Previously, I served as a **Technical Leader** at the **Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)**, where I led consulting and applied research engagements for utilities across North America and internationally. My work focused on large-load and generator interconnection requirements, regional and interregional transmission studies, and the development of technical guidance on voltage control, system stability, and reactive power management. These efforts supported utility planning practices, operational readiness, and regulatory compliance in increasingly dynamic grid environments.

Prior to EPRI, I led the **Transmission & Distribution Advanced Studies team for AES US Utilities**, encompassing AES Ohio and AES Indiana, overseeing long-term planning, system stability analysis, electromagnetic transient (EMT) studies, and interconnection assessments. This work supported capital planning decisions, enhanced regional reliability, and informed regulatory filings and stakeholder processes. Earlier in my career, I worked at Ford Motor Company, contributing to the design of next-generation vehicle electrical systems, which strengthened my perspective on electrification and complex system integration.

Throughout my career, I’ve built and mentored **high-performing technical teams**, guided **cross-functional collaboration**, and contributed to industry leadership efforts through organizations such as PJM, MISO, WECC, NERC, NATF, and IEEE. I hold an M.S. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania, and an M.S. and Ph.D. from The Ohio State University, in power system dynamics, stability, and control. I am a licensed Professional Engineer (PE) in the State of Ohio, United States.

### What I enjoy

I’m passionate about translating complex technical challenges into real-world, scalable solutions — whether it's **decarbonization**, **bulk power system planning**, or **reimagining the future of the grid**.

One of the most fulfilling parts of my work has been building and leading **high-performing technical teams** — creating environments where engineers are empowered to innovate, grow, and do their best work. I enjoy guiding early-career talent, setting a clear vision, and removing roadblocks so teams can move fast without losing sight of quality or purpose.

I also love connecting the dots between strategy, policy, and physics — and helping cross-functional groups align around technically sound, future-ready decisions. Whether it’s a brainstorming call, a working group, or an all-day study review, I find energy in honest, curious conversations that move the industry forward. And when I’m not navigating interconnection policy or transmission strategy, I find joy in **speaking at conferences /webinars**, mentoring others, and being part of **honest, nerdy conversations about where the power sector is headed**. Those moments of shared curiosity and collective thinking are what keep me excited about this industry.
