Hi there! This is Rajarshi (রাজর্ষি). I know my name can be a mouthful 😄 — so feel free to call me **Raj**. And if you're curious, the name ‘Rajarshi’ in Bengali (বাংলা) loosely translates to “a king who has the qualities of a sage.”

### A bit about my work…

I’m a **grid modernization and power systems strategy leader** with over a decade of experience in **bulk power system planning, interconnection, stability, and advanced controls**.

Currently, I serve as the **Manager of Transmission Planning** at **Xcel Energy’s western footprint (Public Service Company of Colorado – PSCo)**, where I **lead a team of engineers responsible for long-term transmission planning, regional reliability studies, and renewable integration strategy across Colorado and the broader Western Interconnection**. My team collaborates closely with regulatory bodies, transmission owners, and regional entities to ensure that the grid remains reliable, and resilient. My team's work collectively guides multi-billion-dollar transmission investments across Xcel Energy’s western footprint. These projects are transforming the Western Interconnection, unlocking new renewable generation, strengthening cross-state reliability, and enabling large-scale electrification that drives economic growth across Colorado and the broader Mountain West. I take pride in cultivating technical excellence within my team — mentoring engineers, leading complex transmission studies, and fostering a high-performance, collaborative culture that delivers lasting impact.


Previously, I served as a **Technical Leader** at the **Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)**, where I led consulting and applied R&D projects for utility clients across North America and globally. My role involved working closely with system planners, operators, and policymakers to guide large-load interconnection requirements, lead regional and interregional transmission studies, and author industry-leading reports on voltage control, stability, and reactive power management. I also helped utilities develop frameworks for grid readiness in high-renewable and electrification scenarios, integrating emerging technologies and control strategies to ensure reliability and regulatory compliance. These efforts directly informed transmission planning standards, investment priorities, and operational strategies across the North American power grid.

Prior to EPRI, I led the **Transmission & Distribution Advanced Studies team for AES US Utilities**, encompassing AES Ohio and AES Indiana, where I oversaw long-term transmission planning, system stability, electromagnetic transient (EMT) analysis, and generator interconnection studies. My team’s work directly informed strategic capital investments that enhanced regional reliability, accelerated renewable integration, and stimulated economic growth across the Midwest. These studies not only guided utility infrastructure expansion but also influenced regulatory filings and system planning practices adopted across the region.

Earlier in my career, I worked at Ford Motor Company, where I helped design and architect next-generation electrical systems for flagship vehicles including the F-150 and Mustang Mach-E — experiences that deepened my understanding of complex system integration and electrification challenges. 

Throughout my career, I’ve built and mentored **high-performing technical teams**, guided **cross-functional collaboration**, and contributed to industry leadership efforts through organizations such as PJM, MISO, WECC, NERC, NATF, and IEEE. I am also a licensed Professional Engineer (PE) in the state of Ohio.

### What I enjoy

I’m passionate about translating complex technical challenges into real-world, scalable solutions — whether it's **decarbonization**, **bulk power system planning**, or **reimagining the future of the grid**.

One of the most fulfilling parts of my work has been building and leading **high-performing technical teams** — creating environments where engineers are empowered to innovate, grow, and do their best work. I enjoy guiding early-career talent, setting a clear vision, and removing roadblocks so teams can move fast without losing sight of quality or purpose.

I also love connecting the dots between strategy, policy, and physics — and helping cross-functional groups align around technically sound, future-ready decisions. Whether it’s a brainstorming call, a working group, or an all-day study review, I find energy in honest, curious conversations that move the industry forward. And when I’m not navigating interconnection policy or transmission strategy, I find joy in **speaking at conferences /webinars**, mentoring others, and being part of **honest, nerdy conversations about where the power sector is headed**. Those moments of shared curiosity and collective thinking are what keep me excited about this industry.
