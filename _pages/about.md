Hi there! This is Rajarshi (‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶ú‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶∑‡¶ø). I know my name can be a mouthful üòÑ ‚Äî so feel free to call me **Raj**. And if you're curious, the name ‚ÄòRajarshi‚Äô in Bengali (‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ) loosely translates to ‚Äúa king who has the qualities of a sage.‚Äù

### A bit about my work‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm a **grid modernization and power systems strategy leader** with over a decade of experience in **bulk power system planning, interconnection, stability, and advanced controls**.

Currently, I serve as a **Technical Leader** at the **Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)**, where I lead consulting and applied R&D projects for utility clients across North America and globally. My role involves working closely with system planners, operators, and policymakers to help modernize the grid, enable clean energy integration, and ensure stability and reliability in a fast-changing landscape.

Previously, I led the **T&D Advanced Studies** team for AES US Utilities ‚Äî including **AES Ohio** and **AES Indiana** ‚Äî where I oversaw long-term planning, stability, EMT, and interconnection studies. These efforts helped shape strategic transmission investments that not only strengthened regional reliability but also supported economic development across the Midwest.

Before that, I was at **Ford Motor Company**, helping architect next-generation electrical systems for the **F-150** and **Mustang Mach-E**. Along the way, I‚Äôve built and mentored high-performing teams, guided cross-functional stakeholder collaboration, and contributed technical expertise to industry groups including **PJM, MISO, NERC, NATF, and IEEE**. I‚Äôm also a licensed **Professional Engineer (PE)** in the state of Ohio.

### What I enjoy

I‚Äôm passionate about translating complex technical challenges into real-world, scalable solutions ‚Äî whether it's **decarbonization**, **bulk power system planning**, or **reimagining the future of the grid**.

One of the most fulfilling parts of my work has been building and leading **high-performing technical teams** ‚Äî creating environments where engineers are empowered to innovate, grow, and do their best work. I enjoy guiding early-career talent, setting a clear vision, and removing roadblocks so teams can move fast without losing sight of quality or purpose.

I also love connecting the dots between strategy, policy, and physics ‚Äî and helping cross-functional groups align around technically sound, future-ready decisions. Whether it‚Äôs a brainstorming call, a working group, or an all-day study review, I find energy in honest, curious conversations that move the industry forward. And when I‚Äôm not navigating interconnection policy or transmission strategy, I find joy in **speaking at conferences /webinars**, mentoring others, and being part of **honest, nerdy conversations about where the power sector is headed**. Those moments of shared curiosity and collective thinking are what keep me excited about this industry.
