Hi there! This is Rajarshi (রাজর্ষি). I understand that my name can be difficult to pronounce, :smile: so feel free to chop everything after the first three letters and just call me Raj! By the way, if you are interested, the meaning of 'Rajarshi' in Bengali (বাংলা) loosely translates to 'a king who has characteristics of a saint'. 

As for work, I am an industry expert in the field of bulk power system planning, stability and control. With a decade of experience in power systems and advanced controls I have had the opportunity to contribute to high-impact projects that had significant strategic importance. Currently, I'm a Technical Leader at the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), where I provide technical leadership for an array of consulting and applied R&D projects for utilities around North America and also globally. Previously, I led the T&D Advanced Studies team for the two AES US Utilities, in Dayton (AES Ohio aka Dayton Power & Light) and in Indiana (AES Indiana aka Indianapolis Power & Light) leading all long term planing, stability, EMT and facility interconnection studies that led to the development of large scale transmission projects in both Ohio and Indiana, United States. I was also heavily involved in R&D activities with universities, national labs and other public and private entities to develop and test new grid technologies and was awarded multiple US Department of Energy Awards to deploy and demonstrate new grid technologies. I have also regularly provided subject matter expertise to a wide variety of industry stakeholder groups in North America, including PJM, NERC and WECC. Before joining AES Utilities, I worked at Ford Motor Company, in Dearborn, MI, as a Research Engineer where I helped to develop Ford's next-gen electrical architecture for some of its best selling global nameplates like F-150, and the Mustang Mach-E. I am also a licensed Professional Engineer (PE) in the state of Ohio, United States. 


I firmly believe in the power of collaboration and interdisciplinary approaches. If you are an industry professional and wish to connect, for a technical webinar or pick my brain on a topic related to power systems, send me an email (Link at the bottom). If you're a student and would like to be mentored, please send me a detailed email on your research interests and your expectations from this mentorship. I have mentored many students at all levels from undergrads to postgrads and continue to receive mentorship requests. Since its impossible for me to accept all,  a clearly written email with your research interests and goals will help me to understand if this is a collaboration worthwhile for both of us to pursue. 

 I invite you to explore my website, where you'll find some of my insights, projects, resources, and updates in the field of power systems. Whether you're an industry professional, researcher, or simply curious about the remarkable intricacies of power grids, I hope you find inspiration and valuable information within these virtual walls. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn (link at the bottom of this page) or send me an email to say 'Hi' (Link at the bottom).
